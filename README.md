# Rocket League Bingo

---

Inspired by the gamemode by popular Rocket League Content Creator [SunlessKhan](https://www.youtube.com/c/sunlesskhan), this is Rocket League Bingo.

### How to play

Just like old fashioned paper bingo, the rules are simple. Complete the challenges in the game to cross them off the card. Once you get 5 (five) challenges completed in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), you win!

If you want to keep playing, just reload the page and you will get a new randomized bingo card!
